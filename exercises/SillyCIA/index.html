        <p>LANGLEY, VA- A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has
            mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.
        </p>

        <p>According to the report, sections of the documents- "almost invariably the most crucial passages" -are marred by an
            indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began
            at the agency's inception in 1947.
        </p>

        <p>CIA Director <strong>Porter Goss</strong> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars
        of several historic events, such as:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The Cold War</li>
            <li>The Civil Rights Movement</li>
            <li>The growth of the international drug trade</li>
        </ul>
